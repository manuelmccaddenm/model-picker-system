# Testing Guide

## What's Fixed

### 1. Pydantic Schema Issues ✅
- All `Dict[str, Any]` replaced with strict Pydantic models
- `Implementation.hyperparameters` is now a JSON string
- `MemoryUpdate.new_experiences` uses `Experience` model
- Compatible with OpenAI's strict JSON schema mode

### 2. Conversational Data Agent ✅
- Agent asks 1-3 questions at a time
- Thinks about your answers and asks intelligent follow-ups
- Continues conversation until it has: task, target, and preferences
- Stores preferences in `business_rules`

### 3. App Flow ✅
- Checks for clarifying_questions first (not task/target)
- Allows multiple conversation rounds
- Only exits when no more questions AND task/target are set

## Run the Full System

```bash
python app.py data/sample.csv
```

### Expected Flow:

**Round 1:**
```
Agent: What do you want to predict?
You: [answer]
```

**Round 2:**
```
Agent: Which column is your target? [suggestions based on data]
You: [answer]
```

**Round 3:**
```
Agent: What matters more: interpretability or accuracy?
You: [answer]
```

**Round 4 (maybe):**
```
Agent: [intelligent follow-up based on your previous answers]
You: [answer]
```

**When done:**
```
✓ Task identified: ...
✓ Target identified: ...
```

Then proceeds to:
- **Model Agent**: Proposes 3 models with J definition
- **Eval Agent**: Runs rapid loop (evaluate & mutate)
- **Eval Agent**: Runs slow loop (meta-learning)

## What Should Work Now

1. ✅ Interactive conversation with Data Agent
2. ✅ Handoff to Model Agent (no schema errors)
3. ✅ Model Agent proposes 3 models
4. ✅ Eval Agent evaluates with J loss
5. ✅ Full pipeline completion
